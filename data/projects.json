        "The Masterplan proposes a regenerative vision for Siracusa through integrating environmental resilience, social infrastructure and strategic phasing. Drawing on the city's etymological roots in Syraka, meaning a city with an abundance of water, the masterplan responds to contemporary challenges of drought and pollution from its petrochemical legacy.",
        "As the city transitions towards clean energy, climate-resilient agriculture and sustainable tourism, water is repositioned as the driver of regeneration, transforming it from a scarce resource into an urban, ecological and social catalyst. This vision is articulated through the Loop, an intersecting blue-green system where land meets water.",
        "The Loop forms a continuous infrastructure for infiltration, attenuation and retention through reactivating historic quarries, river channels and the coastline. The strategy supports regional mobility, climate adaptation and heritage revival, while guiding controlled densification to limit sprawl, envisioning a regenerative model for Siracusa and Sicily."

After her passing in 2017, her parents partnered with Oxford Health Charity to propose a music room at Warneford Hospital, Oxford. Their initiative highlighted the potential of music as a therapeutic tool for mental health. This project, inspired by Lucy's story, celebrates the healing power of music through spaces designed for sensory experiences, restoration, education and community engagement.",

The palette of materials, lighting, acoustics and landscapes, underpinned by biophilic principles and sustainable systems, supports therapy and music use. Comfort and sustainability guide the design, positively shaping user experience and the building's life cycle."
