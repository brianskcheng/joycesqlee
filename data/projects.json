In response to PolyU\u2019s long-standing need for flexible, high capacity academic and research space, the south west redevelopment of A Wing and GH Annex delivers a 15 storey building with 19,400 sqm of usable space, providing laboratories, workshops, classrooms, study areas, communal facilities, and offices.",
        "The design enhances the university\u2019s identity by extending the campus\u2019 podium for improved connectivity. The lower levels introduce stepping terraces with planting to reduce impact at street level and retaining PolyU\u2019s signature red brick. Above, curved glass facades and metal cladding of the \u2018tower\u2019 contrast with its solid base, symbolising the balanced values of heritage and innovation at the university."

        "As the city transitions towards clean energy, climate-resilient agriculture and sustainable tourism, water is repositioned as the driver of regeneration, transforming it from a scarce resource into an urban, ecological and social catalyst. This vision is articulated through the Loop, an intersecting blue-green system where land meets water.",

The strategy supports regional mobility, climate adaptation and heritage revival, while guiding controlled densification to limit sprawl, envisioning a regenerative model for Siracusa and Sicily."

This project, inspired by Lucy\u2019s story, celebrates the healing power of music through spaces designed for sensory experiences, restoration, education and community engagement.",

Comfort and sustainability guide the design, positively shaping user experience and the building\u2019s life cycle."
